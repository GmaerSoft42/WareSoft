### VBSoft
Welcome to `Software`'s VBSoft section, where I will be storing all of my VBS scripts.

The way to close the VBS loops are to end their tasks with the Windows Task Manager. There is 2 ways to open Task Manager. The first option is by pressing Ctrl + Alt + Delete then click "Task Manager" and the second option is by pressing Ctrl + Shift + Esc then wait. After, find the task "Microsoft Â® Windows Based Script Host" and right click, then click "End task".
