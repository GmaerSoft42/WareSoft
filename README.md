## VBSoft:
This is **where** I will be *storing all* of ***my*** VBS (Windows Visual Basic Script) codes and programs.

***WARNING!*** The VBS codes are *more towards **pranks*** but Windows might detect it as a virus. Be careful though as the [`/VBSoft/Deadly`](https://github.com/GamerSoft24/Software/tree/Main/VBSoft/Deadly) folder, the codes there are actually ***deadly*** and can *crash your RAM* in just a **few seconds running.**

## CPPSoft:

This is **where** I will be *storing all* of ***my*** C & C++ codes and programs although it's name is CPPSoft (C++ Software).

The codes will be more *focused* on **C++** rather then **C** and also there will be lots of codes working with external devices, like NodeMCU boards.

It is recommended to have [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) installed on your PC as a lot of programs will require it. Please check the ["Programs.md"](https://github.com/GamerSoft24/Software/blob/Main/Programs.md) file for informations about programs requiring Arduino IDE.
